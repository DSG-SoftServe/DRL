So, here are the results for Breakout by 2 Human players, played sets with delays   0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1  0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3     seconds    
(each set contained at least  10 results) in order to investigate the delay influence on a Human player performance. The assumptions of a delay  impact were  based on some researches of a Human reaction

The scale of delays was also taken regarding the above researches.
On the graph below you can see the Human performance increases till delay is 0,25s. Higher delay provides no game score increase.
Suggestions are to map delays on explanations:
 
0,3s   - High Delay, easy to play for  any person
0,25s  - Optimal delay, no extra skills or reaction needed
0,2s – Normal delay, the player is concentrated and extra tension required
0,15s – Low delay, complicated to play and extra skills, reaction and tension required.
0,1s – Very low delay, for experienced and skilled players
0,02s – Extremely low delay, Human player hardly can perform any  actions
